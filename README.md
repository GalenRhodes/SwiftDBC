# SwiftDBC
SwiftDBC is _very_ loosely based on the Java JDBC library. It's aim is to provide a Swift interface to different databases by having an abstraction layer away from vendor specific differences in
database access libraries.

# API Documentation
Documentation of the API can be found here: [SwiftDBC API](http://galenrhodes.com/SwiftDBC/)

# MySQL Implementation
The first database system that is implemented is MySQL.
