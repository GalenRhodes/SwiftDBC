# SwiftDBC
SwiftDBC is _very_ loosely based on the Java JDBC library. It's aim is to provide a Swift interface to different databases by having an abstraction layer away from vendor specific differences in database access libraries.

# API Documentation
Documentation of the API can be found here: [SwiftDBC API](http://galenrhodes.com/SwiftDBC/)

# Arbitrary Width Integers (aka: BigInt)
For support of very large integers of arbitrary size I came across [BigInt](https://github.com/attaswift/BigInt). I like it because it's 100% pure swift without the need for external library dependencies and it doesn't use any Apple macOS specific APIs so it will build on Linux without modification.

It is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/attaswift/BigInt/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and I am using it as-is without modification.

It has been added to this project as a package dependency.

# MySQL Implementation
The first database system that is implemented is MySQL.

## MySQL Dependency
Naturally there is a dependency on the MySQL libraries. Currently, the MySQL 8.0.19 for Mac OS X client libraries _(libcrypto.1.1.dylib, libmysqlclient.2.1.dylib, and libssl.1.1.dylib)_ are included in this project and I'm embedding those libraries into the Framework object and linking against them. If you're building this on Linux you'll need to install the client library and link against those instead.

# Help Appreciated!
If some industrious folks want to fork this project and start working on support for other databases such as _(but not limited to)_ Oracle, Postgre, Microsoft SQL Server, etc. Please feel free and I'll gladly consider your pull requests! ðŸ˜Ž

# Swifty Stuff
Here's just a few of the places where I've taken advantage of Swift's features.

## NSRecursiveLock -> RecursiveLock
Even though they've included a version of [NSRecursiveLock](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsrecursivelock) in the open source version of Swift I still get nervous that one day all the NS* classes will suddenly disappear. So I created a wrapper around NSRecursiveLock called simply "RecursiveLock". That way if I suddenly have to recreate it at least I won't have to rename it.

Also as part of RecursiveLock I've create a method called:
<pre>func withLock&lt;T&gt;(_ lambda: () throws -> T) rethrows -> T</pre>

So that rather than the standard design pattern of:
<pre>
do {
    lock.lock()
    defer { lock.unlock() }
    /* Do something here. */
}
</pre>

We can now just do this:
<pre>
lock.withLock { /* Do something here. */ }
</pre>

It will even allow returned values and throws.
<pre>
let val = try lock.withLock { try iReturnAValueOrThrowAnError() }
</pre>

## NSCondition -> Conditional
For the same reasons as above I created a wrapper around [NSCondition](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscondition) called simply "Conditional".

Also, along with the "withLock(_:)" method above, I've also included a new method called:

<pre>public func withLockWait&lt;T&gt;(cond: () -> Bool, _ lambda: () throws -> T) rethrows -> T</pre>

This method takes two enclosures. One to test the condition and the other to execute once the condition is met.

So instead of saying:
<pre>
do {
    lock.lock()
    defer {
        lock.signal()
        lock.unlock()
    }
    while !someCondition() {
        lock.wait()
    }
    /* Do something here! */
}
</pre>

You can now simply say this:
<pre>
lock.withLockWait(cond: { someCondition() }) { /* Do something here! */ }
</pre>

So much more clear!

Also, the version of "withLock(_:)" in Conditional calls "signal()" right before it calls "unlock()".
