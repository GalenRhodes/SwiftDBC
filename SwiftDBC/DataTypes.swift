/// connection.
///
/// A Connection object's database is able to provide information describing its tables, its supported SQL grammar, its stored
/// procedures, the capabilities of this connection, and so on. This information is obtained with the `metaData` property.
///
/// Note: When configuring a `DBConnection`, SwiftDBC applications should use the appropriate `DBConnection` method such as setting
/// the `autoCommit` property. Applications should not invoke SQL commands directly to change the connection's configuration when
/// there is a SwiftDBC method available. By default a `DBConnection` object is in auto-commit mode, which means that it
/// automatically commits changes after executing each statement. If auto-commit mode has been disabled, the method commit must be
/// called explicitly in order to commit changes; otherwise, database changes will not be saved.
///
/// A new `DBConnection` object created using the SwiftDBC API has an initially empty type map associated with it. A user may enter
/// a custom mapping for a UDT in this type map. When a UDT is retrieved from a data source with the method
/// `DBResultSet.getObject()`, that method will check the connection's type map to see if there is an entry for that UDT. If so,
/// the `DBResultSet.getObject()` method will map the UDT to the class indicated. If there is no entry, the UDT will be mapped
/// using the standard mapping.
///
/// A user may create a new type map, make an entry in it, and pass it to the methods that can perform custom mapping. In this
/// case, the method will use the given type map instead of the one associated with the connection.
